# Skat Trainer: Meta SDK, ATT and remote switches (inert)

Ported from Bridge Trainer, which took it from Mahj 1.4.1. Mahj's
`.claude/rules/meta-ads.md` and `project-docs/marketing/meta-ads.md` hold the
full story.

- `MetaAds` is inert while `META_APP_ID` and `META_CLIENT_TOKEN` are empty in
  `project.yml` (they are empty): no SDK start, no ATT prompt, nothing sent. It
  never starts on a simulator either. The Facebook SDK (exact 18.1.1,
  `FacebookCore`) is linked and its Info.plist keys are present (German
  `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription`), so turning it on is two strings. Change the
  App Store privacy labels and add a Meta section to the privacy page in the
  SAME submission that sets the ids, never before.
- `MetaAds.start` runs in `AppDelegate`, `linkRevenueCat()` right after
  `Purchases.configure`, `activateApp()` on every foreground.
- ATT is asked only after a trial start or a purchase (Jack 2026-10-19), so
  only paying players are prompted and the relay can count a consented trial
  within its 15 minutes. `SubscriptionService.purchase` calls
  `MetaAds.notePurchase()` on every completed purchase (onboarding page,
  paywall; restore is not a purchase), which stores `meta.askAfterPurchase`;
  `HomeView.askForTrackingIfNeeded` asks on the next bare Home and
  `requestTracking` clears the flag. A player who never starts a trial or buys
  never sees the prompt. Guards kept: onboarded, bare Home, 1.2s settle, not in
  a launch that showed What's New (`WhatsNew.shownThisLaunch`), after the
  offering loaded (`remoteConfigKnown`), and `att_prompt` not `off`. Never move
  it to launch or onboarding. `askApple()` stays `nonisolated` (Swift 6 trap).
- StartTrial belongs to a server relay, never to RevenueCat's Meta integration.
  The relay lives in the Mahj repo (`supabase/functions/meta-trial-relay`) and is
  NOT ported. When Skat gets a Meta app id the relay needs a per-app row/config
  (its Meta dataset id, token and RevenueCat webhook entry) before the ids go
  into `project.yml`, or trials are never reported.
- `RemoteConfig` reads the current RevenueCat offering's metadata: `trial_cta`
  (`seven_day` control: "7 Tage kostenlos starten" on onboarding and
  "7-Tage-Test starten" on the paywall; `my`: "Meine Probewoche starten";
  `your`: "Deine Probewoche starten") and the switches `att_prompt`,
  `rating_prompt`, `challenge` (on unless exactly `off`; set the same on every
  offering). The `challenge` switch is declared but nothing reads it: Skat has
  no challenge yet, and one must gate its Home card and deep link on it. DEBUG
  builds pin any key with `-skat.rc.<key> <value>`; `-skat.previewMetaATT` shows
  the real ATT alert in captures.
