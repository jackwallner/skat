# Skat Trainer: screenshots

Moved verbatim from CLAUDE.md. Loads when a matching file is read; update it here.

## Screenshots

`scripts/capture-screenshots.sh <udid> <out-dir> [prefix]` drives the real app
through the App Store screens via the `Screenshots` scheme.
`scripts/with-ipad-sim.sh` creates a throwaway 13-inch iPad (App Store iPad
shots must be 2064x2752 and the agent-sim pool has no iPad Pro), boots it
headless, and deletes it on exit:

```bash
./scripts/with-ipad-sim.sh sh -c './scripts/capture-screenshots.sh "$IPAD_UDID" out ipad_'
```

Gotchas baked into the test: the What's New sheet covers Home on the first
launch after a version bump and returns every time Home reappears, so the
script passes the marketing version in through
`TEST_RUNNER_SCREENSHOT_APP_VERSION` and the test marks it seen; returning to
the root only taps navigation-bar button 0 while a back button is there,
because on Home that button is the Settings gear; and the test never calls
XCTFail, because a failing UI test spends ten minutes collecting simulator
diagnostics first.
