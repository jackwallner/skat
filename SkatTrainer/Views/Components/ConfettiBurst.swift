/// element is the whole point: a burst that always erupts from the middle of
/// the screen doesn't celebrate anything in particular.

/// a firework, not a celebration). Pieces launch along a wide upward fan from
/// across the source's WIDTH, decelerate through linear air drag toward a slow
/// terminal fall, sway as they tumble, and flip end over end (the width squash
/// fakes the third dimension). Ribbons mixed in with the chips keep the shapes
