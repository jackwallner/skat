/// A `ScrollView` that CENTERS its content when the content is shorter than
/// the viewport, and scrolls exactly like a plain one when it is taller.

/// Drills are scroll views because a graded question with its coaching note can
/// outgrow an iPhone. On an iPad that same question fills a third of the screen
/// and a bare `ScrollView` pins it to the top, leaving a field of empty cream
/// under it — which is what the first iPad build showed.
///
/// The mechanic is `minHeight`, not `height`: content taller than the viewport
/// keeps its natural size and scrolls, so nothing about the iPhone layout, the
/// answer-glow headroom, or `scrollTo` changes.
