/// Captures the App Store screenshot set from the real app, on whatever

/// screens by hand is how you end up shipping a stale set.

/// Run: scripts/capture-screenshots.sh <udid> <out-dir> [prefix]
///
/// Not part of the SkatTrainer scheme's test action — it lives on its own
/// `Screenshots` scheme so the unit-test loop stays fast.
///
/// The test never fails on a missing element. A hard XCTFail makes Xcode spend
/// ten minutes collecting simulator diagnostics before it reports anything,
/// which turns every navigation typo into a very slow question. Instead it
/// records what it could not find and attaches the element tree, so one run
/// tells you both what you got and why the rest is missing.
